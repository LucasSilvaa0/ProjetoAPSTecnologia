This is the project made by me to compete for the job in "APS Tecnologia". I made this website being the fullstack developer using ReactJS, TypeScript and ZOD in Frontend and using TypeScript, Express and ZOD in backend.
The project is a website to register people using email, password, phone number, CNPJ and CEP. To make these, I had to create a validation field in backend to test if the CEP and CNPJ really exist and are valid.

There are some pages in the website. Let's se.
